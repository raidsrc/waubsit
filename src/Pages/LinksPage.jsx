        <div className="mb-10 md:mb-20 ">
          <LinkBlock title="Raid" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/raidsrc">My YouTube channel, where I upload music content and other short videos. Music content includes covers, rearrangements, original compositions, and tutorials. Other short videos include school projects, expository content, guides, and cinematic TV features.</LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="Rude Custard">My BandCamp page, where I release music. Expect an eclectic blend of jazz, hip-hop, dubstep, rock, and video game soundtrack. My music is available on almost all popular music platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.) but I'm linking my BandCamp page because BandCamp is <span className="font-bold">simply better.</span> <span className="bg-red-400">(coming soon!)</span></LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="Rewrite, Rebuild, Repeat" href="http://uwp101y.raidsrc.me">An online portfolio of essays and blog posts I wrote for <span className="italic">UWP 101Y - Advanced Composition</span>. In this body of work, I investigate the history, geography, and circumstances of two urban redevelopment schemes in the San Francisco Bay Area and examine how money, location, and collective civic action have shaped the outcomes of both projects. There's a chance they'll ask you for a password if you want to gain entry. Email me for that.</LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="Tractivity" href="https://tractivity.raidsrc.me" >A fitness-tracking web application I developed for <span className="italic">ECS 162 - Web Programming</span>. This application supports Google sign-in using OAuth 2.0, logging of past and future activity, and data visualization of recorded progress.</LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="Shop 'Til You Drop" href="https://shop-til-you-drop.raidsrc.me" >My final project for <span className="italic">ECS 162 - Web Programming</span>; a web application I developed for the exhibit <span className="italic">Education Should Be Free</span> at the Manetti Shrem Museum at the University of California, Davis. Use this web application to estimate the cost of education at various public universities in California using data drawn from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard.</LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="The Slippi Sampler" >A mechanism I engineered for transforming Super Smash Bros. Melee inputs into music. This mechanism works with any valid Slippi replay file (.slp) and outputs MIDI notes with millisecond-perfect temporal precision. <span className="bg-red-400">(coming soon!)</span></LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="Virovek" href="https://virovek.com" >The website for Virovek, my family's Hayward-based gene therapy company. I played a major role in debugging the website's stylesheets. It's built on WordPress, which I'm not very familiar with, but I managed to work my magic all the same.</LinkBlock>

          <LinkBlock title="Professor Raid Schools the Masses on Smash Bros." href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=supYVmjGi50">A lecture on Super Smash Bros. Melee that I presented for <span className="italic">CTS 172 - Metagaming</span>, a course all about "examining the community histories and material practices that have evolved alongside videogames as a mass medium, cultural commodity, and digital technology." This class just might be one of the most enjoyable university courses I've ever taken.</LinkBlock>

I usually put a link to this page in my bio or elsewhere on my profile on whatever site I'm on. It's a sparse webpage with a list of links to where I'm at. The YT channel, Twitter, music providers, my main site here, etc. It's also got a brief "About Me" section.
