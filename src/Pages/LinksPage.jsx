                     An online portfolio of essays and blog posts I wrote for <span className="italic">UWP 101Y - Advanced Composition</span>. In this body of work, I investigate the history, geography, and circumstances of two urban redevelopment schemes in the San Francisco Bay Area and examine how money, location, and collective civic action have shaped the outcomes of both projects. There's a chance they'll ask you for a password if you want to gain entry. Email me for that.

Use this web application to estimate the cost of education at various public universities in California using data drawn from the U.S. Department of Education's College Scorecard.

                     A mechanism I engineered for transforming Super Smash Bros. Melee inputs into music. This mechanism works with any valid Slippi replay file (.slp) and outputs MIDI notes with millisecond-perfect temporal precision. <span className="bg-gray-600">(coming soon!)</span>

                     The website for Virovek, my family's Hayward-based gene therapy company. I played a major role in debugging the website's stylesheets. It's built on WordPress, which I'm not very familiar with, but I managed to work my magic all the same.

                     A lecture on Super Smash Bros. Melee that I presented for <span className="italic">CTS 172 - Metagaming</span>, a course all about "examining the community histories and material practices that have evolved alongside videogames as a mass medium, cultural commodity, and digital technology." This class just might be one of the most enjoyable university courses I've ever taken.

The YT channel, Twitter, music providers, my main site here, etc. It's also got a brief "About Me" section.
