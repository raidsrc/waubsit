                      I'm Raymond. I usually go by Ray, but people have known me by many names. Some of these names were given to me. Some of them I chose myself. Some of them are silly, and some I think are pretty cool. Regardless, I feel as though every single one of these names has become an important part of my identity—as much an essential part of who I am as my hometown, my date of birth, or my favorite color.

                      I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area. I was born here and I've lived most of my life here. I've been all around the world and experienced all sorts of different cultures and climates; still, the Bay is and has always been my favorite place. Not once have I grown weary of returning home to it.

                      Currently, I'm a rising senior at the University of California, Davis, completing a major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. My favorite subjects of study so far have been full-stack web development, bioinformatics, genetics, the ethics of technology, and the neuroscience of music. I'm also kind of interested in writing, editing, teaching, and activism.

                      After I graduate, I'm headed to <NewTab href="https://www.virovek.com">Virovek</NewTab>, a small Hayward-based gene therapy manufacturing company founded and directed by my beloved mother and father. I'm going to manage web, communications, and business technology, and help out with the biotech manufacturing pipeline when needed. People ask me if it's reassuring, knowing that I have a place to work right out of college. I tell them no. Because it's not what I really want to do. I'd rather be a full-time musician. Haha. I'll figure out a way to make it work somehow.

                      I like Kendrick Lamar, Chinese food, ice cold spring water, and exploring the unknown. I like driving fast with the windows down and viewing the world from high places. I dislike candy, soda, humid weather, and mushrooms. Everybody always tells me that mushrooms are amazing and that I simply haven't had a great-tasting mushroom. I doubt it. I've tried a lot of mushrooms and they all suck.
