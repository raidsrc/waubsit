              Hey. I'm Raymond. I usually go by Ray, but people have known me by many names. Most of these names were given to me. Some of them are silly, and some I think are pretty cool. Regardless, I feel as though every single one of these names has become an important part of my identity—as much an essential part of who I am as my hometown, my date of birth, or my favorite color.

              I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area. I was born here and I've lived most of my life here. I've been all around the world and experienced all sorts of different cultures and climates; still, the Bay is and has always been my favorite place. Not once have I grown weary of returning home to it.

              Currently, I'm a rising senior at the University of California, Davis, completing a major in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. My favorite subjects of study so far have been full-stack web development, bioinformatics, genetics, the ethics of technology, and the neuroscience of music. I'm also kind of interested in writing, editing, teaching, and activism.

              After I graduate, I plan to spearhead a web and communications technology advancement initiative at <NewTab href="https://www.virovek.com">Virovek</NewTab>, a small Hayward-based gene therapy manufacturing company founded and directed by my beloved mother and father. Also gonna help out with the biological manufacturing pipeline when needed. People ask me if it's reassuring, knowing that I have a place to work right out of college. And I am very grateful for this position. But honestly, I'd rather be a full-time street musician. Haha. I'll make that happen. Just you wait.

              I like Kendrick Lamar, Chinese food, ice cold spring water, and exploring the unknown. I like driving fast with the windows down and viewing the world from high places. I dislike candy, soda, humid weather, and mushrooms. Everybody always tells me that mushrooms are amazing and that I simply haven't had a great-tasting mushroom. I doubt it. I've tried a lot of mushrooms and they all suck.

              In my free time, I enjoy programming, lifting weights, cooking, learning new things, editing videos, and making music. I also really enjoy skiing, snowboarding, and skateboarding, even though I don't typically get to do those things very often.
